/**
 * Voice input via the **system speech recogniser**, for devices whose microphone the app cannot open
 * itself.
 *
 * This is the route that makes a Sony remote's mic usable. The remote's microphone is not an audio
 * input device at all — the audio HAL reports none, and `android.hardware.microphone` is absent — so
 * `AudioRecord` has nothing to open. But the TV's voice app (Katniss, the default
 * `RecognitionService`) does have privileged access to it, and binding to it as a recogniser makes
 * it record on our behalf and hand back text.
 *
 * The cost is that transcription happens in Google's recogniser rather than Home Assistant's
 * speech-to-text; only the finished sentence reaches HA. Everything *after* the words is still the
 * pipeline's, though — the sentence is fed to `assist_pipeline/run` at its `intent` stage, so the
 * assistant's own agent answers, its own voice speaks, and its own "prefer handling commands
 * locally" setting applies.
 *
 * That last part is why this is not `conversation.process`. Addressing the pipeline's agent
 * directly, as this used to, threw away everything else the assistant was configured with: a TV
 * with a local agent preferred for simple commands sent "turn on the kitchen light" to an LLM and
 * waited five seconds for it. Measured on the UR3 before the change.
 *
 * [SpeechRecognizer] is main-thread-only, hence the handler hops.
